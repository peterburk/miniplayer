iTunes 10 Style Mini Player

iTunes 11 brought a new MiniPlayer. The new version doesn’t allow people to change the player position, or to view back/play/next buttons at the same time as the artist and album. In my opinion, the iTunes 10 MiniPlayer was much better! So I rewrote it from scratch.

Images are pulled from screenshots. Maybe Apple won’t be happy. I’m not intending to plagiarise, I’m just trying to restore the functionality they removed! Keeping a consistent user interface is the best way to satisfy users, in my opinion.

The source code is available for developers too. Many of the user interface elements are hacked together using messy subclasses; if you have a good suggestion to clean up the code, please let me know!
